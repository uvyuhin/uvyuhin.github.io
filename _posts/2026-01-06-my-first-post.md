This is my first blog post! I'm learning how to use Jekyll and GitHub Pages to create a simple, elegant blog.

Jekyll makes it really easy to write posts in Markdown. Here's some of what you can do:

## Formatting

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, and `code snippets`.

### Code Blocks

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### Lists

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

I'm looking forward to sharing more content soon!
